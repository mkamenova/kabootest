First of all, we would like to know how analytic your mind is when it comes to writing good and clear BDD specifications from a business requirement written in plain English.

You need to transform the following business requirement + design into BDD, covering the full functionality of the feature. Can you see anything that is not covered by the business requirement but it is in the design?

FRONT-END
As a user I want to see my reward history (the ones I have obtained and claimed) in the Freebies Vault Section
the functionality would be:
  
  - When user claims a reward (token) the "Your history" section will be displayed
  - Each token will display 1 characteristic thumbnail 
  - Only the last 8 tokens will be displayed

BACK-END (JSON object)
a) By using the method `/igc/betspin/rewards/history` with only 1 param `userName`, 
   we will get a JSON with an array of unique tokens claimed by that user.
b) Each unique token claimed could have been claimed more than once (sub-array objects)
c) The following info will be contained for each sub-array object: game-slug,date 
   claimed, info, reason, expiry date.
d) The response will be in chronological order in the array and sub-array.
USE THIS DESIGN TO COMPLETE THE BDD SPECS:
